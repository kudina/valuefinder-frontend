    <p className='font-semibold pt-9 text-dark'>Growing up in a third world country as a teenage orphan, 
    I had no choice than doing every menial job I could get and learning every available skill
     that would help me survive, ranging from weeding compounds to hawking and so on... Somehow,
      the people who watched me grow into a man have come to develop so much trust and confidence
       in me to deliver on my promises and as such will seek my opinion on a whole lot of things...</p>

           Nowadays, I get minimum of five calls a week from family and close friends,
            either asking me for the contact of an expert in some industry or lobbying
             me to recommend them to people I know who need their services. Either ways,
              there is an indication of a strong desire to get value for money or skill
               by these people and I have been severally compensated for helping out.
           </p>


           <p className='font-semibold pt-5 text-dark'>A lot of people said I was crazy when I spoke to  them about expanding this
             solution mechanism beyond my circle, because I have some multi-million dollar
              companies to contend with. 

            However, I figured these companies seem to focus only on people who can work 
            remotely, thereby leaving ccrftsmenen like Barbers, Plumbers, Makeup artists, 
            etc helplessly out of this rewarding scheme</p>

        Artisans with limited education and exposure  on the
